Azure
=====

A minimalist theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), based on
[Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) for Jekyll.

Quick Start
-----------

To serve the example site ensure Hugo is installed and run the following command from the base directory of this repository:

``` shell
hugo serve --source=exampleSite --themesDir=../../
```

To use in your own project:

1. Add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule, git submodule add https://github.com/jdahm/azure.git themes/azure.
2. Configure your config.toml. You can either use the this minimal configuration as a base, or look for a complete explanation about all configurations here. The config.toml inside the exampleSite is also a good reference.
3. Build your site with hugo serve and see the result at http://localhost:1313/.
